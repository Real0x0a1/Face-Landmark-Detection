# Face Landmark Detection

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview

The "Face Landmark Detection" project utilizes the power of Mediapipe, an open-source library, to identify and visualize facial landmarks in real-time through a webcam feed. The script captures video frames from the default camera (camera index 0), applies facial landmark detection, and overlays green dots on the detected facial landmarks. The landmarks include key points such as eyes, nose, and mouth.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install mediapipe
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Real0x0a1/Face-Landmark-Detection.git
   cd face-landmark-detection
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 FaceLandmarkDetection.py
   ```

3. Press 'q' to exit the application.
